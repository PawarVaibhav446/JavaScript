'let & const declarations are Hoisted'
 They are Block Scoped.

=> let & const are placed in different memory space.
   it is not present in global or window object.

Example:

console.log(b); // Undefined
console.log(a); // (Refernce error) cannot access 'a' before intialization
let a = 10;
var b = 100;

"Temporial dead zone" 
=> is a time since when the let variable is hoisted 
   and till it is intialzed some value. 
   The time between is called Temporial dead zone.

"No Duplication is allowed in let declarations"

Example:

let a = 10;
let a = 12; // (SyntaxError): redeclaration of let 'a'.

we Cant use var a = 10; also !!!.


"Const Is More Strict than let"

Example:

let a;
a = 100;  // This is Possible
console.log(a);

const b;  // SyntaxError: missing = in const declaration
b = 12;   // This is not Possible 
console.log(b);

const b = 12; // This is Possible
 b = 10;      // TypeError

Difference between SyntaxError v/s RefernceError v/s TypeError

=> TypeError: We cannot change value to type constant.
=> SyntaxError: Error/missing/Duplication in Syntax (e.g. const b; (no '=')).
=> RefernceError: When we cannot access variable before intialization or access any undefined varaibles.


What Should we use between 'let','const' and 'var' ?
=> Priority Should be 1)const 2)let 3)var

How to Avoid problems related to Temporial dead zone?
=> You Should always declare your variables at the start of the program(at the top).
