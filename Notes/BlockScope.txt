Block:
"A Block is Defined by two curly bracket{}"

"It is Also known as Compound Statement"
=> as it groups multiple JavaScript Statement.

Why Do We Use Block?
=> "We Group multiple Statement in a Block so that we can use it where JavaScript expects one Statement"

Example:

if(true){
    var a = 10;
    console.log(a);
}

What is Block Scope?
=> What all variable & functions we can access inside this Block.

Example:

{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;

    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    console.log(c);
}
    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    console.log(c);

=> Here 'a' is hoisted in Global Scope while 'b' & 'c' are placed in Block.
   Here 'b' will be not defined (refrence error) if we access 'b' outside the Block.

"Shadowing In JavaScript"
=> If we have same name variable outside the Block then it Shadows it.
=> 'let' and 'const' have 'Script' Shadowing rather than 'Block' scope while for 'var' it is opposite.

"Illegal Shadowing"
=> We Cannot change the identifiers.

Example:

let x = 20;
{
    var x = 30;
}

But We Can do This:

var x = 20;
{
    let x = 30;
}
